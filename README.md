# week3-assignment

This is a walking skeleton for a cookie clicker template.

## Required

- What requirements did you achieve?

  I managed to fetch the API but I haven't tried to update the count with any of the updates.

- Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?

  I could not get my cookies per second to merge with the cookie count itself, it does count and I have displayed this in the cookies per second section (because I am proud of it) but I would have liked that to display in the cookie count section and have the cookies per second show the multiper figure.

- If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?

  Everything was slow moving, I think I am coming round to events now but applying those with the fetched data and timers did get somewhat confusing.

  ## Optional

- Feel free to add any other reflections you would like to share about your submission.

  Resources used:  
  mdn web docs, to help with the grid and box-sizing,  
  I heavily relied on previous class topics and examples,  
  peer support/review,  
  ok soo... to plan my inital layout,  
  YouTube: @WebZoneCode -- reviewed clips about functions and buttons.

## Requirements

- Fetch upgrade data from the provided API and at least one upgrade from the API update the cookie count.

  Fetched data, did not apply an upgrade.

- Ensure that functions are used effectively to keep code organised and reusable.

  I think I did ok at keeping my functions fairly 'pure'

- Implement event listeners to handle user interactions.

  I got my cookie count button to work, I was very pleased with this as I struggled last week to create functional buttons.

- Use local storage to save and restore the cookie count and relevant game information.

  I started this task but I spent too mcuh of my time trying to adjust the cookies per second.

- Use setInterval to increment the cookie count and manage the game state each second.

  I did manage to set an interval timer, and it does counts on the screen. Just not how I would have liked it too, but I was proud of this so am happy to leave it in the wrong place (for now).
  Managing the game state includes saving progress and updating the DOM.

## Stretch Requirements

- Consolidate upgrade management by managing all upgrades in a single function.

  Did not attempt.

- Improve UX with animations, sound effects, or other visual effects.

  Did not attempt.

- Fantastic use of README to provide important information such as a description of the project, how to deploy and other app information.

  Please let me know if my READMEs are easy to read.

- Implement error handling using try/catch.

  Did not attempt.

- Create a menu for users to adjust game options like sound effects or display preferences.

  Did not attempt.
