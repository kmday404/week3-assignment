# week3-assignment

This is a walking skeleton for a cookie clicker template.

## Required

- What requirements did you achieve?
  I managed to fetch the API but I haven't tried to update the count with any of the updates.
- Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
  I could not get my cookies per second to merge with the cookie count itself, it does count and I have displayed this in the cookies per second section but I would have like to have that display the current multipler and the count be one.
- If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
  Everything was slow moving, I think I am coming round to events now but applying those with the fetched data and timers did get somewhat confusing.
  ## Optional
- Feel free to add any other reflections you would like to share about your submission, for example:

Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission.
What useful external sources helped you complete the assignment (e.g YouTube tutorials)?
What errors or bugs did you encounter while completing your assignment? How did you solve them?
What went really well and what could have gone better?

## Requirements

- Fetch upgrade data from the provided API and at least one upgrade from the API update the cookie count.
  Fetched data, did not apply an upgrade.
- Ensure that functions are used effectively to keep code organised and reusable.
  I think I did ok at keeping my functions fairly 'pure'
- Implement event listeners to handle user interactions.
  I got my cookie count button to work, I was very pleased with this as I struggled last week to create functional buttons.
- Use local storage to save and restore the cookie count and relevant game information.
  I started this task but I spent too mcuh of my time trying to adjust the cookies per second.
- Use setInterval to increment the cookie count and manage the game state each second.
  I did manage to set an interval timer, and it does counts on the screen. Just not how I would have liked it too, but I was proud of this so am happy to leave it in the wrong place (for now).
  Managing the game state includes saving progress and updating the DOM.

## Stretch Requirements

- Consolidate upgrade management by managing all upgrades in a single function.
  Did not attempt.

- Improve UX with animations, sound effects, or other visual effects.
  Did not attempt.

- Fantastic use of README to provide important information such as a description of the project, how to deploy and other app information.
  Please let me know if my READMEs are easy to read.

- Implement error handling using try/catch.
  Did not attempt.

- Create a menu for users to adjust game options like sound effects or display preferences.
  Did not attempt.
